## Sigrid | Software Assurance Platform

[Sigrid](https://www.softwareimprovementgroup.com/solutions/sigrid-software-assurance-platform/) helps you to improve your software by measuring your system's code quality, and then compares the results against a benchmark of 10,000 industry systems to give you concrete advice on areas where you can improve.

Sigrid performs code quality checks that have been designed by the [Software Improvement Group](https://www.softwareimprovementgroup.com/), which have been used by thousands of development teams over the past 20 years to help improve their software. SIG's approach is based on the ISO 25010 standard for software quality, and has been accredited to ensure alignment with the standard.

Integrating Sigrid's feedback into your development pipeline enables you to fix quality issues right away during your code reviews, instead of having to spot and fix them after the fact. You can access Sigrid's feedback through [sigrid-says.com](https://sigrid-says.com), or directly within your Continuous Integration environment.

Compared to other tools that perform code quality checks, i.e. linters, using Sigrid has a number of advantages:

- **Quality guard:** Sigrid ensures both the quality of your code and the quality of the system as a whole.
- **Pragmatic:** Other tools block changes if even a single issue is found. This is not cost-effective. Sigrid CI allows some minor issues as long as the overall quality is acceptable. Code quality should be good, but it doesn't have to be perfect.
- **Benchmarked:** We rate quality against thousands of other systems, not against theoretical perfection or a subjective target.

## Sigrid API

Most of this documentation refers to our recommended way to integrate Sigrid into your development process: add Sigrid to your pipeline, for both pull requests and publishing code. However, in some cases you might need a more flexible type of integration. The [Sigrid API documentation](docs/sigrid-api-documentation.md) contains an overview of the available data that you can obtain from Sigrid's API and integrate into your workflow.
