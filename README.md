# Sigrid | Software Assurance Platform

[Sigrid](https://www.softwareimprovementgroup.com/solutions/sigrid-software-assurance-platform/) helps you to improve your software by measuring your system's code quality, and then compares the results against a benchmark of 15,000 industry systems to give you concrete advice on areas where you can improve.

Sigrid performs code quality checks that have been designed by the [Software Improvement Group](https://www.softwareimprovementgroup.com/), which have been used by thousands of development teams over the past 20 years to help improve their software. SIG's approach is based on the [ISO 25010 standard for software quality](https://www.iso.org/standard/35733.html), and has been accredited to ensure alignment with the standard.
