Integrating Sigrid CI with GitLab
=================================

This guide explains how to integrate Sigrid into your GitLab continuous integration pipeline. Make sure you have also read the [general Sigrid CI documentation](README.md) before starting this guide.

## Prerequisites

- You have a [Sigrid](https://sigrid-says.com) user account. 
- You have created an [authentication token for using Sigrid CI](authentication-tokens.md).
- [Python 3.7 or higher](https://www.python.org) needs to be available in the CI environment. The client scripts for Sigrid CI are based on Python.

## On-boarding your system to Sigrid

On-boarding is done automatically when you first run Sigrid CI. As long as you have a valid token, and that token is authorized to on-board systems, you will receive the message *system has been on-boarded to Sigrid*. Subsequent runs will then be visible in both your CI environment and [sigrid-says.com](https://sigrid-says.com). 

## Configuration

**Step 1: Configure Sigrid credentials to environment variables**

Sigrid CI reads your Sigrid account credentials from two environment variables, called `SIGRID_CI_ACCOUNT` and `SIGRID_CI_TOKEN`. To add them to your GitLab CI pipeline, follow these steps:

- Select "Settings" in your GitLab project's menu
- Select "CI/CD" in the settings menu
- Locate the section named "Variables"
- Click the "Add variable" button
- Add an environment variable `SIGRID_CI_ACCOUNT` with the account name you have received

- Add another environment variable, `SIGRID_CI_TOKEN`, and add the Sigrid CI token you have received

These instructions describe how to configure a single GitLab project, but you can follow the same steps to configure the entire GitLab group, which will make the environment variables available to all projects within that group.

**Step 2: Download the Sigrid CI client scripts and make them available to your Sigrid CI environment**

Sigrid CI consists of a number of Python-based client scripts, that interact with Sigrid in order to analyze your project's source code and provide feedback based on the results. These client scripts need to be available to your GitLab runners, in order to call the scripts *from* the CI pipeline. 

The scripts can be obtained by either cloning or downloading this repository, and moving the `sigridci` directory to a location that is available to the GitLab runners. 

**Step 3: Add Sigrid CI to your project's CI pipeline**

Next, you need to edit your project's CI configuration, in order to add Sigrid CI as an extra step. Open `.gitlab-ci.yml` in your project's root directory and add the following:

```
stages:  
- report

sigridci:
  stage: report
  script:
    - git clone https://github.com/Software-Improvement-Group/sigridci.git sigridci
    - ./sigridci/sigridci/sigridci.py --customer examplecustomername --system examplesystemname --source . --targetquality 3.5
  allow_failure: true
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - "sigrid-ci-output/*"
    expire_in: 1 week
    when: always
  except:
    - master
    
sigridpublish:
  stage: report
  script:
    - git clone https://github.com/Software-Improvement-Group/sigridci.git sigridci
    - ./sigridci/sigridci/sigridci.py --customer examplecustomername --system examplesystemname --source . --targetquality 3.5 --publish
  allow_failure: true
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - "sigrid-ci-output/*"
    expire_in: 1 week
    when: always
  only:
    - master
```

This configures two additional build steps:

- The `sigridci` step provides Sigrid feedback for pull request. This step is configured to run for every branch *except* the main/master branch.
- The `sigridpublish` step publishes project snapshots to [sigrid-says.com](https://sigrid-says.com). This step only runs for the main/master branch.

**Security note:** This example downloads the Sigrid CI client scripts directly from GitHub. That might be acceptable for some projects, and is in fact increasingly common. However, some projects might not allow this as part of their security policy. In those cases, you can simply download the `sigridci` directory in this repository, and make it available to your runners (either by placing the scripts in a known location, or packaging them into a Docker container). 

The relevant command that starts Sigrid CI is the call to the `sigridci.py` script, which starts the Sigrid CI analysis. The scripts supports a number of arguments that you can use to configure your Sigrid CI run. The scripts and its command line interface are explained in [using the Sigrid CI client script](client-script-usage.md).

Finally, note that you need to perform this step for every project where you wish to use Sigrid CI. Be aware that you can set a project-specific target quality, you don't necessarily have to use the same target for every project.

## Usage

Once you have configured the integration, Sigrid CI will show up as a new step in your GitLab CI pipeline. The step will succeed if the code quality meets the specified target, and will fail otherwise.

Sigrid CI provides multiple levels of feedback. The first and fastest type of feedback is directly produced in the CI output, as shown in the following screenshot:

<img src="images/feedback-ci-environment.png" width="600" />

The output consists of the following:

- A list of refactoring candidates that were introduced in your merge request. This allows you to understand what quality issues you caused, which in turn allows you to fix them quickly. Note that quality is obviously important, but you are not expected to always fix every single issue. As long as you meet the target, it's fine.
- An overview of all ratings, compared against the system as a whole. This allows you to check if your changes improved the system, or accidentally made things worse.
- The final conclusion on whether your changes and merge request meet the quality target.

In addition to the textual output, Sigrid CI also generates a static HTML file that shows the results in a more graphical form. This is similar to test coverage tools, which also tend to produce a HTML report. You can download this report form GitLab using the "download" button on the right side of the CI results view:

The information in the HTML report is based on the aforementioned list, though it includes slightly more detail.

Finally, if you want to have more information on the system as a whole, you can also access [Sigrid](http://sigrid-says.com/), which gives you more information on the overall quality of the system, its architecture, and more.
