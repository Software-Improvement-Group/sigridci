# Sigrid on-premise integration

Most of this documentation refers to the software-as-a-service version of Sigrid, which can be accessed via [sigrid-says.com](https://sigrid-says.com) and is used by the vast majority of Sigrid users. However, SIG also offers an on-premise version of Sigrid. This document covers everything you need to integrate Sigrid on-premise in your environment. It also covers the functional differences between the SaaS version and the on-premise version, though these differences are relatively minor.

## High-level overview

<img src="../images/onpremise-overview.png" width="600" />

- Sigrid on-premise is based on [Docker containers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_%28software%29). There are two types of containers:
  - Application containers that should be deployed permanently in a [Kubernetes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kubernetes) cluster, based on a [Helm chart](https://helm.sh) that is provided by SIG.
  - Analysis containers that run from a build pipeline within your development platform. These analysis containers may also be started on Kubernetes, but that is not a requirement. Supported development platforms are listed in [development platform integration](#development-platform-integration).
- SIG provides the necessary images through a container registry. The section [obtaining Sigrid on-premise](#obtaining-sigrid-on-premise) contains more information on how you can obtain and update these Docker containers.
- Authentication is based on your identity provider, using [OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/developers/how-connect-works/). Alternatively, [SAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAML_2.0) or [LDAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_Directory_Access_Protocol) are also supported, through [Dex](https://dexidp.io/).
- Analyses are triggered from a build pipeline. The analysis results are then imported into a Postgres database, so they can be viewed in Sigrid.
- Large files are stored in an [S3-compatible object store](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/).

Some Sigrid on-premise features are *optional*:

- The Open Source Health feature requires outbound internet access. Sigrid needs to connect to external sources to check for the latest vulnerability data for open source libraries. If you do not allow outbound internet access, the Open Source Health feature is not available. The rest of Sigrid is unaffected.
- When viewing detailed analysis results, Sigrid displays relevant source code files within Sigrid. For this to work, a web-accessible code storage needs to be available. This integrates with Sigrid via [OAuth](https://oauth.net/2/). For this to work, the identity provider used for Sigrid authentication and for the code storage needs to be the same. For viewing source code within Sigrid, you need to provide a development platform that is integrated with the same identity provider as Sigrid itself. The view source functionality is optional, without this integration the rest of Sigrid is unaffected.

## Obtaining Sigrid on-premise

The Docker containers that form Sigrid on-premise are distributed via [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com). You will receive an account that allows you to access the container registry. 

<img src="../images/onpremise-dockerhub.png" width="500" /> 

As explained above, Sigrid consists of several Docker containers. The container `sigrid-multi-analysis-import` will run directly in your development platform's continuous integration pipelines, all other containers are deployed to your Kubernetes cluster. These steps are explained in more detail in the following sections.

### Updating Sigrid on-premise to a new version

SIG releases the Sigrid Docker containers based on a [continuous delivery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery) process. This means that changes are immediately released once they have successfully passed through the development process. We advise our clients on the best way to develop and operate their software, so we try to adhere to the same best practices that we recommend our clients. 

This does not necessarily mean you need to *immediately* pull the Docker containers after every release. However, you need to pull the latest versions of the Docker containers at least once a month. SIG does not provide support for versions of the Docker containers over a month old. Updating frequently reduces the "delta" between the current version and the new version, thereby reducing update risk. Once a month is merely the *minimum* update frequency, we actually recommend you update as frequently as possible.

Although Sigrid consists of several Docker containers, you will need to update them collectively. It is theoretically possible to update some containers without updating other containers, but this gets complicated very quickly and we don't recommend this way of working to our on-premise clients. So when you update Sigrid on-premise, you will need to update all Docker containers to the same version.

This also means SIG does not back-port any changes to older versions: If you want to access new features or bugfixes, you will need to update the Docker containers to the latest version. 

### Updating your environment

In addition to updating Sigrid itself, you will also need to periodicially update your environment in which Sigrid runs. SIG uses the following support policy for infrastructure component versions:

- For Kubernetes, we support the latest 2 major versions. You can track the Kubernetes version history in [this overview](https://kubernetes.io/releases/).
- For Postgres, we also support the latest 2 major versions. You can track the Postgres version history in [this overview](https://www.postgresql.org/support/versioning/).

## Deploying Sigrid into a Kubernetes cluster

SIG will provide you with a [Helm Chart](https://helm.sh) to configure and install Sigrid on-premise. A Postgres database needs to be set up separately.

## Identity provider integration

Sigrid on-premise integrates with your identity provider through [OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/developers/how-connect-works/). You can either use an identity provider that "natively" supports OpenID Connect, or you can use middleware like [Dex](https://dexidp.io) that allows your identity provider to integrate with other systems. The installation of Dex is an optional feature of the Sigrid Helm chart. Alternatively, [KeyCloak](https://www.keycloak.org) can also be used to connect Sigrid to different identity providers, however this should be installed separately.

Locate the `sigrid-stack.auth-api` section in your Helm Chart's `values.yaml` file. Update the configuration properties so that they refer to your identity provider. 

## Development platform integration

In the on-premise version of Sigrid CI, the analysis runs as part of your continuous integration pipeline. Importing the analysis results into Sigrid is also done within the pipeline. Unlike the software-as-a-service version, the on-premise version of Sigrid CI does *not* publish your source code to Sigrid, so your source code never leaves your development platform.

The on-premise Sigrid CI requires the `sigrid-multi-analysis-import` Docker container. The steps for including this container in your pipeline are different for each development platform. The next sections cover some common examples:

### GitHub pipeline integration

Your can add Sigrid CI on-premise to your GitHub pipeline by creating [GitHub Actions YAML files](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions) inside of the `.github/workflows` directory.

```
name: sigrid-publish
on:
  schedule:
     - cron: "0 0 * * *"

jobs:
  sigridci:
    container:
      image: softwareimprovementgroup/sigrid-multi-analysis-import
      env:
        CUSTOMER: YOUR_SIGRID_CUSTOMER
        SYSTEM: YOUR_SIGRID_SYSTEM
        POSTGRES_HOST_AND_PORT: YOUR_DATABASE_HOST:5432
        POSTGRES_PASS: $SIGRID_REVIEW_ONPREM_POSTGRES_IMPORTER_PASS
    steps:
      - ln -s $PWD /tmp/sources
      - /usr/local/bin/all-the-things.sh
      - mv /tmp/analysis-results/sigridci .
```

Note this is a *generic* example, the specifics might be slightly different depending on how you have configured your on-premise GitHub.

This example will analyze your code on a daily basis. It is also possible to run the analysis after every change, and provide feedback in pull requests. Refer to the [Sigrid CI GitHub documentation](../sigridci-integration/github-actions.md) for more information.

### GitLab pipeline integration

Your can add Sigrid CI on-premise to your GitLab pipeline by editing the `.gitlab-ci.yml` configuration file:

```
sigridci-onpremise:
  stage: test
  image: softwareimprovementgroup/sigrid-multi-analysis-import
  entrypoint: [""]
  variables:
    CUSTOMER: YOUR_SIGRID_CUSTOMER
    SYSTEM: YOUR_SIGRID_SYSTEM
    POSTGRES_HOST_AND_PORT: YOUR_DATABASE_HOST:5432
    POSTGRES_PASS: $SIGRID_REVIEW_ONPREM_POSTGRES_IMPORTER_PASS
  script:
    - ln -s $PWD /tmp/sources
    - /usr/local/bin/all-the-things.sh
    - mv /tmp/analysis-results/sigridci .
  artifacts:
    reports:
      junit: sigridci/sigridci-junit-format-report.xml
    paths:
      - sigridci/index.html
      - sigridci/feedback.md
    expire_in: 1 week
    when: always
  rules:
    - if: $CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == "schedule"
```

- This example assumes your pipeline includes a stage called `test`. If your pipeline is structured differently you will need to replace this with the name of the appropriate stage where you want Sigrid CI to run. 
- Replace `YOUR_SIGRID_CUSTOMER` and `YOUR_SIGRID_SYSTEM` with your Sigrid customer account name and system name, respectively. If you're not sure about your Sigrid customer account name, ask your Sigrid administrator. You can choose your own system name, though system names can only contain letters, numbers, and hyphens.
- Replace `YOUR_DATABASE_HOST` with your Postgres database host name. Your GitLab pipeline should be able to access this host.
- Use `$SIGRID_REVIEW_ONPREM_POSTGRES_IMPORTER_PASS` to configure the password of your Postgres database. Use [GitLab secrets](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/secrets/) to provide this password, *do not* hard-code this password in your YAML file.
- The `rules` section at the bottom means Sigrid CI will only run as a scheduled job. Refer to the [GitLab documentation on how to create scheduled pipelines](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/pipelines/schedules.html) so that you can periodically publish your system to Sigrid, for example as a nightly build. Remove the `rules` section if you want to use Sigrid CI continuously and publish your system to Sigrid after every commit. 

### Azure DevOps pipeline integration

Your can add Sigrid CI on-premise to your Azure DevOps pipeline by editing your [Azure DevOps pipeline configuration file](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/yaml-schema/?view=azure-pipelines). Azure DevOps does not enforce a standardized name for this configuration file, but it typically lives in the root of your repository.

```
stages:
  - stage: Report
    jobs:
      - job: SigridPublish
        pool:
          vmImage: ubuntu-latest
        container: softwareimprovementgroup/sigrid-multi-analysis-import
        continueOnError: true
        steps:
          - bash: "/usr/local/bin/all-the-things.sh"
            env:
              CUSTOMER: YOUR_SIGRID_CUSTOMER
              SYSTEM: YOUR_SIGRID_SYSTEM
              POSTGRES_HOST_AND_PORT: YOUR_DATABASE_HOST:5432
              POSTGRES_PASS: $SIGRID_REVIEW_ONPREM_POSTGRES_IMPORTER_PASS
            continueOnError: true
```

- Replace `YOUR_SIGRID_CUSTOMER` and `YOUR_SIGRID_SYSTEM` with your Sigrid customer account name and system name respectively. If you're not sure about your Sigrid customer account name, ask your Sigrid administrator. You can choose your own system name, though system names can only contain letters, numbers, and hyphens.
- Replace `YOUR_DATABASE_HOST` with your Postgres database host name. Your GitLab pipeline should be able to access this host.
- Use `$SIGRID_REVIEW_ONPREM_POSTGRES_IMPORTER_PASS` to configure the password of your Postgres database. Use [GitLab secrets](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/secrets/) to provide this password, *do not* hard-code this password in your YAML file.

Next, you will need to schedule *when* you're going to publish your system to Sigrid. Azure DevOps allows you to [schedule pipelines](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/process/scheduled-triggers?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml). You can use this to periodically publish your system to Sigrid, for example as a nightly build. Alternatively, you can use Sigrid CI on a more continuous basis by running the pipeline step after every commit.

## Functional differences in Sigrid on-premise

- The on-premise Sigrid distribution is single tenant. You cannot create your own "tenants", all systems and analyses will end up in your portfolio. That said, you can still use Sigrid’s user management to define which people should have access to which systems.
- [Mendix Quality and Security Management](https://www.softwareimprovementgroup.com/mendix-quality-and-security-management-powered-by-sigrid/) is only available if you are using Mendix in combination with GitHub or GitLab.

## Technical differences in Sigrid on-premise

- The on-premise Sigrid distribution does not support scheduling. It is assumed that analyses are performed from your continuous integration pipeline.
