# System-level Code Explorer

The Code Explorer view lets you explore a system’s codebase and maintainability findings that are associated with it. 

## Different views
Exploring the codebase can be done e.g. by directory tree or components (as defined in the system’s configuration). Because maintainability findings can be grouped on a file level, “problem hotspots” in the code can be found.

## Assisting in planning with Issue tracker text 
Findings that you wish to solve later on can be exported as text with static links for your issue tracker.
