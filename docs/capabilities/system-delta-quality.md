# System-level delta quality
Delta quality is a part of the system maintainability analysis. As such it is default for all systems. It requires more than 1 snapshot to make a comparison. 

You can reach this view in different ways: Via the top menu, or clicking an a capability on the System or Portfolio *Overview* pages. See the [system-level Overview page](system-overview.md#navigating-to-capabilities) or [portfolio-level Overview page](portfolio-overview.md#navigating-to-capabilities).

Within *Delta quality*, there are three tabs available :
* **New code**: this shows the code quality of newly added files. 
* **Changed code**:this shows the quality of existing files in which a change has been made, and 
* **New & changed code**: this shows the balance of all changed- and added code quality. 

*New code* tends to give you the best indication of whether new development is creating high quality software. For *Changed code*, quality effects may be limited unless deliberate refactoring/renovation has been done.
