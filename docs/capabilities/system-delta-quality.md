# System-level delta quality

<img src="../images/system-delta-quality.png" width="600" />

Within *Delta quality*, there are three tabs available :
* **New code**: this shows the code quality of newly added files. 
* **Changed code**:this shows the quality of existing files in which a change has been made, and 
* **New & changed code**: this shows the balance of all changed- and added code quality. 

*New code* tends to give you the best indication of whether new development is creating high quality software. For *Changed code*, quality effects may be limited unless deliberate refactoring/renovation has been done.
