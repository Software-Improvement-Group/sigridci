Technology support
==================

The table below describes all technologies that can be analyzed by Sigrid. The first column refers to how the technology should be named in the [configuration file](analysis-scope-configuration.md), specifically for setting languages in your scope file, [see the technology support section](../reference/analysis-scope-configuration.md#technology-support).

Technologies are sometimes referred to by multiple names. For example, some people call their code NodeJS instead of JavaScript. If we are being pedantic, JavaScript is the name of the programming language and NodeJS is the name of the runtime. However, in practice many people just use these names interchangeably, so both are listed to prevent confusion.

Finally, note the column "supported Sigrid capabilities" does not list Open Source Health. The reason is that Open Source Health is based on open source ecosystems, not specific technologies. Refer to the section on [supported technologies for Open Source Health](#supported-open-source-ecosystems) for more information.

Notes:

1. Use either `c` or `cpp`, but not both.
  - Prefer `cpp` if your system contains a combination of C and C++ code.
2. Use one of `javascript`, `react`, `vuejs`, `sapui5`, but do not use multiple.
  - Prefer `vuejs` if your system contains [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) components that use the `.vue` file extension.
  - Prefer `react` if your codebase contains [React](https://reactjs.org) and/or [JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html).
  - Only use `sapui5` if you are using [SAP UI](https://developers.sap.com/topics/ui-development.html).
  - Use `javascript` in all other cases.
3. Use either `typescript` or `vuets`, but not both.
  - Prefer `vuets` if you're using [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) in combination with TypeScript code. 
  - Prefer `typescript` in all other cases.
4. Use either `vb` or `vbnet`, but not both.
  - Prefer `vbnet` for Visual Basic code running on the .NET platform, or when not sure.
  - Use `vb` for [classic Visual Basic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic_(classic)), which has been end-of-life since 2008.
5. In most cases, configuration files are not considered part of production code and are therefore not relevant for Sigrid's maintainability analysis. Only add these technologies if you consider them part of the system's production code.
6. "Unknown technology" will be shown in Sigrid when the technology cannot be detected.
7. Use either `html` or `angularjstemplate`, but not both.
  - Prefer `angularjstemplate` if you're using [Angular templates](https://angular.io/guide/template-syntax).
  - Use `html` for all other types of HTML files or templates.
8. You can use Sigrid CI for this technology, but you will need to use a special option. See instructions on how to [technology conversion configuration](#technology-conversion-configuration) below.
9. Sigrid CI is not supported for this technology. You can still use Sigrid, but you will need to use one of the [alternative upload channels](../organization-integration/upload-instructions.md).

## Technology conversion configuration

For the vast majority of technologies, you can simply publish your repository and have your code analyzed by Sigrid. However, a small number of technologies cannot be analyzed by Sigrid in its "native" format. In those situations, Sigrid needs to convert these technologies to another format before it can be analyzed.

This configuration can be managed using the `--convert` [option in Sigrid CI](client-script-usage.md#command-line-options). This is only applicable for the following technologies:

| Technology          | Value of the `--convert` option                                         |

## Supported open source ecosystems

In addition to supporting 300+ technologies, Sigrid also supports various open source ecosystems for its Open Source Health capability. Note that different projects might use different open source ecosystems, even if they use the same technology. For example, there is no standardized way to manage open source dependencies in Java projects. Some Java projects use Maven, others use Gradle. This is why some technologies are listed multiple times in the table below.

| Open source ecosystem | Common technologies    |
|-----------------------|------------------------|
| Alpine Linux          | Alpine Linux           |
| Bower                 | JavaScript             |

## Supported security analyzers

These are the supported security analyzers as you may see them in your security findings overview. You can use the literal text in the `Display name` below to enable or disable specific analyzers, if deemed necessary. For such configuration, see the [Security/Third Party Findings section section on the system security page](../reference/analysis-scope-configuration.md#third-party-findings).
