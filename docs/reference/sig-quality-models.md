## SIG Quality Model documentation

Since SIG's quality models are based on the ISO 25010 standard, documents are available describing the relationship between the formal ISO definitions and the "application" of those in metrics. The following documents are publicly available on the [SIG website](https://www.softwareimprovementgroup.com):

* [Maintainability Evaluation Criteria:](https://www.softwareimprovementgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/SIG-TUViT-Evaluation-Criteria-Trusted-Product-Maintainability.pdf) (describing the translation from definitions to metrics, partly based on this [scientific paper on maintainability](https://softwareimprovementgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/APracticalModelForMeasuringMaintainability.pdf)).
* [Maintainability Guidance for Producers](https://softwareimprovementgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/SIG-TUViT-Evaluation-Criteria-Trusted-Product-Maintainability-Guidance-for-producers.pdf) (describing conceptual objectives and metrics thresholds to achieve above-average maintainability rating of 4 out of 5 stars).
* [Application security model](https://softwareimprovementgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/SIG-Evaluation-Criteria-Security.pdf) describing best practices against which application security is assessed in manual assessments, partly based on this [scientific paper on security](https://softwareimprovementgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/APracticalModelForSoftwareSecurity.pdf).
* [Architecture Quality Guidance for Producers](https://www.softwareimprovementgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/Guidance-for-producers-Architecture-Quality-Model.pdf).
* [Open Source Health Guidance for Producers](quality_model_documents/open_source_health.md).
